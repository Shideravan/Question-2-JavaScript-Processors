# Question-2-JavaScript-Processors

In this test, I'm simulating a processes which:

1. Selects the high number of the array.
2. Subtracts this number in the process attribute.
3. Reduces the value to floor/2.
4. Substitute the value in the array.
5. Continues the process until the process value is 0 (or below)
6. Gives the number of steps representing the seconds in processing.
